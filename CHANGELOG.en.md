## [Unreleased]

## [1.3.2] - 2026-02-22

### Added

- **ClickHouse high-performance storage backend (major update)** 🗄️
  - Added ClickHouse as an optional analytics storage engine, forming a dual-write architecture alongside SQLite
  - Health-aware write routing: SQLite stats writes are automatically skipped when ClickHouse is healthy, significantly reducing local disk I/O
  - ClickHouse-exclusive mode available for large-scale multi-agent deployments
  - New `ClickHouseWriter` module with batched writes, health monitoring, consecutive-failure fallback, and graceful recovery
- **`NEKO_AGENT_REF` branch testing support**
  - Added `NEKO_AGENT_REF` environment variable to the install script to download `nekoagent` from any GitHub branch
  - E.g. `NEKO_AGENT_REF=refactor/clickhouse` lets you test pre-release branches without modifying the script

### Performance

- **Agent report traffic gzip compression (~10-15x ratio)** 🚀
  - All `neko-agent` HTTP report requests are now gzip-compressed; overnight upload traffic reduced from ~4 GB to ~300 MB
  - Collector transparently decompresses via Fastify `preParsing` hook with no new dependencies
  - Fully backward-compatible: older uncompressed `neko-agent` versions continue to work alongside compressed ones

### Fixed

- **[P0] ClickHouse health check used wrong method, causing silent data loss**
  - Fixed `shouldSkipSqliteStatsWrites` in `app.ts` incorrectly calling `clickHouseWriter.isEnabled()` instead of `clickHouseWriter.isHealthy()`
  - When ClickHouse has consecutive write failures it now correctly falls back to SQLite writes, preventing silent data loss
- **[P1] Agent retry lost requestId, causing duplicate traffic counting**
  - Agent report payload now includes a `requestId` (32-char hex generated via `crypto/rand`)
  - Collector implements server-side idempotency dedup (5-minute TTL Map); duplicate `requestId` arrivals are silently discarded
  - Fixed the old `requeueFront` pattern where re-queuing a failed batch assigned it a new ID, allowing the same data to be counted twice; failed batches now carry the same `requestId` for the entire retry window

### Changed

- **`nekoagent update` / `upgrade` completely rewritten**
  - The old `update` command was re-running the install script and invoking `nekoagent add` — it never actually updated the binary
  - Rewritten to download the target version directly, SHA256-verify it, and replace the installed binary in-place; skips download when already at target version
  - Added `upgrade` as an alias for `update`
- **`nekoagent add` auto-starts by default**
  - `auto_start` default changed from `false` to `true`; instances now start automatically after `add` without requiring a manual `start`
  - Added `--no-start` flag to suppress auto-start when needed
  - Install script `NEKO_AUTO_START=false` now correctly passes `--no-start` through to the `add` command
- **Unified agent versioning**
  - `neko-agent` binary version is now injected at build time via ldflags (`-X ...config.AgentVersion=<tag>`), replacing the previous hardcoded constant
  - CI `agent-release.yml` automatically extracts and injects the version from the git tag; local dev builds report `dev`
  - `nekoagent version` now displays both the manager script version and the `neko-agent` binary version together for consistent version visibility
- **Install script incremental version detection**
  - When an existing installation is detected, the script queries the GitHub Releases API to determine the latest remote version
  - If local version matches the target: skip download and call `nekoagent add` directly; otherwise update the binary first, then add the instance

### Documentation

- **`docs/` directory reorganization**
  - Added `docs/dev/` (ClickHouse analysis and refactor docs) and `docs/research/` (model research reports) subdirectories
  - Added `docs/README.md` (Chinese doc index) and `docs/README.en.md` (English doc index) with categorized clickable links
  - Fixed broken Agent doc links in `README.en.md` that pointed to Chinese `.md` files instead of `.en.md`
  - Architecture guide updated with a dedicated Agent mode section covering deployment topology and data flow

## [1.3.1] - 2026-02-19

### Added

- **Agent mode (major update)** 🤖
  - Introduced passive reporting via `agent://` backends for centralized panel + edge collection deployments
  - Added Agent setup script UX with copy-ready run/install commands
  - Added token rotation flow for controlled re-binding and immediate invalidation of old instances
- **Agent release automation and packaging**
  - Added GitHub Actions: `agent-build.yml` (tests/cross-build) and `agent-release.yml` (multi-arch release)
  - Standardized release artifact naming and checksum publishing (`checksums.txt`)
- **Agent installation and operations tooling**
  - Upgraded installer with architecture detection, release download, checksum verification, and startup
  - Added `nekoagent` management CLI (init/start/stop/status/logs/update/remove/uninstall)
- **Agent documentation set**
  - Added `docs/agent/*` (overview, quick start, install, config, release, troubleshooting)
  - Added release checklist `docs/release-checklist.md`

### Changed

- Refactored backend UX for Agent: add/edit moved into dialogs, action row alignment improved
- Improved Agent Script modal responsiveness and scroll behavior for mobile/smaller viewports
- Locked gateway type (Clash/Surge) after creation to prevent destructive mode mutation

### Security

- Agent token is now system-managed: historical tokens are not re-shown; rotation generates new random token
- Added backend token binding guard: one token cannot be reused by multiple `agentId` values

### Compatibility

- Added protocol/version gate support with `MIN_AGENT_PROTOCOL_VERSION` and `MIN_AGENT_VERSION`
- Incompatible requests now return explicit codes:
  - `AGENT_PROTOCOL_TOO_OLD`
  - `AGENT_VERSION_REQUIRED`
  - `AGENT_VERSION_TOO_OLD`

## [1.3.0] - 2026-02-16

### Added

- **Chain-flow delimiter compatibility (Issue #34)**
  - Rule/node names containing `|` are now supported in chain-flow graphs without key-splitting conflicts
- **GeoIP config status fields**
  - Added `configuredProvider` and `effectiveProvider` to `/api/db/geoip` responses to clearly separate configured vs. runtime-effective source
- **Regression test coverage**
  - Added `app.geoip-config.test.ts` for GeoIP config API behavior
  - Added `db.geoip-normalization.test.ts` for GeoIP normalization compatibility
  - Added chain-flow test coverage for names containing `|`

### Changed

- **GeoIP normalization moved to shared**
  - Added `packages/shared/src/geo-ip-utils.ts` and unified `normalizeGeoIP` usage across frontend/backend
  - Narrowed `IPStats.geoIP` to a structured object type and removed array-shape dependency
  - Applied normalization consistently in collector IP-related query outputs for backward compatibility
- **Config module refactor**
  - Moved `/api/db/*` routes out of `app.ts` into a dedicated `config.controller`
  - Added `autoListen` option to `createApp` for better testability and controlled startup
- **GeoIP service reliability improvements**
  - Reused MMDB required-file constants to avoid hardcoded filenames
  - Added short TTL cache for MMDB missing-file checks to reduce repeated filesystem probes
  - Added queue-overflow logging and `destroy()` resource cleanup
  - Improved private IPv6 detection (including `::ffff:` mapped IPv4) and failure-cooldown handling

### Fixed

- **Fixed `/api/stats/rules/chain-flow-all` 500 errors**
  - Resolved `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'name')` caused by delimiter-based link key parsing
- **Fixed side effects when reading GeoIP config**
  - `GET /api/db/geoip` no longer mutates persisted provider config
  - Settings selection state now follows `effectiveProvider` to avoid UI/runtime mismatch
- **Fixed Windows flag emoji rendering in React Flow chain nodes**
  - Applied `emoji-flag-font` to rule/group/proxy node labels
  - Unified active-link key encoding across backend/frontend to avoid ambiguous link matching

## [1.2.9] - 2026-02-16

### Added

- **Offline GeoIP lookup via local MMDB** 🌐
  - Added IP lookup source switching in Settings (`online` / `local`)
  - Added support for local MMDB files: `GeoLite2-City.mmdb`, `GeoLite2-ASN.mmdb` (required), `GeoLite2-Country.mmdb` (optional)
- **MMDB preflight checks and safeguards**
  - Required MMDB files are validated before enabling local mode
  - Local option is disabled when required files are missing, with missing-file hints in UI
- **MMDB availability fallback safeguards**
  - If MMDB files are removed, runtime lookup now falls back to online API automatically
  - If config is still `local` while MMDB is unavailable, backend auto-reverts persisted provider to `online` to keep UI and runtime behavior consistent
- **Improved local development MMDB directory detection**
  - Improved MMDB directory resolution with multiple candidates and env override support
  - Fixed the case where Local could not be enabled even though MMDB files existed in local development
- **Unified mobile details interaction**
  - Rules page (Domains / IPs) now uses Drawer for mobile details
  - Mobile details behavior is aligned with devices and stats pages
- **Improved settings interaction consistency**
  - `IP Lookup Source` selected-state visuals are now consistent with the Favicon selector
  - Options are now fully row-clickable instead of requiring direct radio-button clicks

### Changed

- Documentation updates (`README.md` / `README.en.md` / `.env.example`):
  - Added clearer local MMDB deployment and mount instructions
  - Clarified that `GEOIP_ONLINE_API_URL` is intended for endpoints compatible with the `ipinfo.my` response schema
  - Consolidated duplicate English README entry points

## [1.2.8] - 2026-02-15

### Performance

- **Up to 60x query performance improvement** 🚀
  - Added `hourly_dim_stats` / `hourly_country_stats` pre-aggregation tables, maintained in real-time on write
  - All dimension queries (domain/ip/proxy/rule/device/country) automatically route to hourly pre-aggregated tables for ranges > 6h
  - Timeseries query optimization: `getHourlyStats`, `getTrafficInRange`, `getTrafficTrend`, `getTrafficTrendAggregated` now read directly from `hourly_stats` for long-range queries instead of scanning and re-aggregating `minute_stats`
  - 7-day range queries reduced from ~10,080 rows scanned to ~168 rows
  - Per WebSocket broadcast total row scans reduced from ~20,160 to ~336
- **`resolveFactTableSplit` hybrid query strategy**: Long-range queries split into hourly (completed hours) + minute (current hour tail) for both performance and precision

### Added

- **Testing Infrastructure** 🧪
  - Introduced Vitest framework with unit tests for `traffic-writer`, `auth.service`, and `stats.service`
  - Added test helpers (`helpers.ts`)
  - Added ESLint configuration and `.env.example`
- **Time Range Picker Enhancements**
  - Added "1 hour" quick preset, replacing the default 30-minute view
  - Added "Today" quick option for trend charts (midnight to current time)
  - Moved 30-minute preset to debug short presets list
- **`BatchBuffer` module**: Standalone batch buffering module, decoupled from collector

### Fixed

- **Cookie authentication security**: Changed `secure` flag from `process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'` to `request.protocol === 'https'`, fixing login loop on HTTP intranet environments where cookies could not be set
- **Windows emoji flag display**: Added `emoji-flag-font` CSS class to proxy-related components (list, chart, grid, interactive stats, rule stats) to fix broken flag emoji rendering on Windows

### Refactored

- **Global AuthGuard refactoring**: Extracted authentication logic from dashboard layout into a standalone `AuthGuard` component, simplified `auth.tsx` and `auth-queries.ts`
- **Collector service decomposition**: Significantly slimmed down `collector.ts` and `surge-collector.ts` by extracting `BatchBuffer` and `RealtimeStore` modules
- Removed legacy `api.ts` entry file, unified to modular controllers

### Technical Details

- `hourly_dim_stats` schema: `(backend_id, hour, dimension, dim_key, upload, download, connections)`, updated in real-time via `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE`
- `resolveFactTable` / `resolveFactTableSplit` methods implemented in `BaseRepository`, shared across all repositories
- Timeseries query thresholds: `getTrafficInRange`/`getTrafficTrend` switch to `hourly_stats` at > 6h; `getTrafficTrendAggregated` switches when `bucketMinutes >= 60`
- Seamless upgrade: new tables auto-created via `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`, existing `minute_dim_stats` data backfilled to hourly tables on first startup

## [1.2.7] - 2026-02-14

### Fixed

- **Surge collector short-lived connection traffic loss**: Fixed issue where traffic deltas for completed connections (status=Complete) were not being counted; uses `recentlyCompleted` Map to record final traffic and correctly calculate differences
- **Cleanup timer determinism**: Changed `recentlyCompleted` cleanup from `setInterval` to deterministic triggering tied to the polling cycle
- Fixed IPv6 validation logic using Node.js native `net.isIPv4/isIPv6`

### Refactored

- **Database Repository Pattern Refactoring** 🏗️
  - Split the 5400+ line monolithic `db.ts` into 14 independent Repository files
  - Added `database/repositories/` directory with Repository Pattern architecture
  - Slimmed `db.ts` down to ~1000 lines, retaining only DDL, migrations, and one-line delegation methods
  - Extracted Repositories: `base`, `domain`, `ip`, `rule`, `proxy`, `device`, `country`, `timeseries`, `traffic-writer`, `config`, `backend`, `auth`, `surge`
  - `BaseRepository` encapsulates 13 shared utility methods including `parseMinuteRange`, `expandShortChainsForRules`, etc.
- **Code cleanup** (~140 lines removed)
  - Removed unused `parseRule` function, duplicate `buildGatewayHeaders`/`getGatewayBaseUrl`
  - Cleaned up debug `console.log` statements, unused `sleep()`, `DailyStats` import
  - Removed unused `EXTENDED_RETENTION`/`MINIMAL_RETENTION` constants

### Technical Details

- Surge collector uses `/v1/policy_groups/select` endpoint for policy group details
- `BackendRepository` now includes `type: 'clash' | 'surge'` field across create, query, and update flows
- Cleaned up debug code in `/api/gateway/proxies`
